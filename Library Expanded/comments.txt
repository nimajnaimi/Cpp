Comments: I didn't know if I was expected to modify ass3.cpp as I couldn't think of much
else to test. Also, without modifying it I was unsure about if I am still supposed to put a
header for it with my name? I did anyway, as a description is still needed. Would like some more
clarification on this though.

Another thing, the last assignment said something about the constructor class I used, but I didn't
understand what it was suggesting, and whether or not it actually mattered. It said:
"[library.h:17]: (style) Class 'Library' has a constructor with 1 argument that is not explicit."
